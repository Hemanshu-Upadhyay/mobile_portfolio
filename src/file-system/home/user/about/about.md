# Hi there

With over 3 years of expertise in building performance-driven websites and APIs using React, Next.js, and TypeScript, I focus on delivering fast, bug-free, and optimized solutions. Experienced in converting Figma designs into functional components and handling AWS front-end deployments. Additionally, I am seasoned in React Native for mobile application development, particularly for iOS, and leverage AI tools to accelerate project delivery and enhance efficiency.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have developed over my three plus years of coding experience.
